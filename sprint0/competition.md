While Hunter's high-end products that servecing company contain many powerful features and wireless connectivity, our products not only take into account a more detailed positioning and warning system for ordinary home users, but also allow wireless connectivity and stronger compatibility, which can link and expand most existing products on the market, so that there are more than one options when making a choice.
It is possible our competitors more focus on macro physical layer, like how to control water flow and record data from background. Our products attract potential users through stronger compatibility and the detection and precise positioning of micro-specific controllers. Because software compatibility is not what monopolies want, leading companies in the industry are not willing to compromise for the sake of user experience
